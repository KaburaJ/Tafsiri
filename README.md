# Tafsiri: Multilingual Translation Plugin

Tafsiri is a versatile multilingual translation plugin designed with [Outerbase](https://beta.outerbase.com/) integration in mind. It was developed as a submission for the Outerbase Hackathon, in which the creator is participating. [Here's the article I submitted](https://kaburaj.hashnode.dev/tafsiri-outerbases-multilingual-data-translation-plugin). It details how exactly Tafsiri was created and the thought process behind it.

## Usage
While the cell-by-cell translation mode functions smoothly, the batch mode currently has a limitation with the select language functionality. As a temporary solution, the default language during batch mode has been set to French. This is in the [first version](https://github.com/KaburaJ/Tafsiri/blob/main/translatorPluginV1.2.js). The [second version](https://github.com/KaburaJ/Tafsiri/blob/main/translatorPluginV1.2Extended.js) allows for language selection during batch mode.

## Data Sources
The data utilized by Tafsiri can be found at [SQL Playground](https://uibakery.io/sql-playground).
