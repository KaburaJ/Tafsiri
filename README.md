# Tafsiri
Tafsiri is a multilingual translation plugin built with [Outerbase](https://beta.outerbase.com/) in mind. It was my submission for the Outerbase Hackathon in which I am competing.

Currently, Tafsiri is a column plugin. It does translation either cell by cell or in batch mode.

The cell by cell mode works smoothly but in the batch mode, I cannot seem to get the select language functionality to work. Thus, I have set the default language during batch mode to be French.
