Tafsiri is a versatile multilingual translation plugin designed with [Outerbase](https://beta.outerbase.com/) integration in mind. It was developed as a submission for the Outerbase Hackathon, in which the creator is participating.

## Usage
While the cell-by-cell translation mode functions smoothly, the batch mode currently has a limitation with the select language functionality. As a temporary solution, the default language during batch mode has been set to French.

## Data Sources
The data utilized by Tafsiri can be found at [SQL Playground](https://uibakery.io/sql-playground).
